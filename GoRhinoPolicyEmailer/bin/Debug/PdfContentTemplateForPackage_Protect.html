                <h6>Emergency Medical Assist</h6>
                <h5>Direct contact number :  0861 227 323</h5>
                <br />
                <h5>Medical Advice and Information Hotline</h5>
                <p>
                    Medical personnel, including paramedics, nurses and doctors, are available 24 hours a day to provide general medical information and advice. This is an advisory service, as a telephonic conversation does not permit an accurate diagnosis.
                </p>

                <h5>Referral to Crisis Line</h5>
                <p>Bereavement  counselling, HIV counselling, Suicide counselling.</p>
                <h5>Referrals to Medical Practitioners and  Facilities</h5>
                <p>We will  refer you to the nearest medical facility or practitioners.</p>
                <h5>Emergency Medical Response to the Scene of a  Medical Emergency</h5>
                <p> An  appropriate response will be undertaken whereby a response vehicle will be  dispatched immediately to the scene of a medical emergency where appropriate  life saving support will be provided to the member/s and where relevant, the  member/s will be stabilised before transfer is provided to the closest  appropriate medical facility.</p>
                <h5>Medical Transportation</h5>
                <p>In the  event of you experiencing a medical emergency, we will arrange for emergency  medical transport to the nearest medical facility capable of providing adequate  care. Medical considerations, the degree of urgency, your state and fitness to  travel and other considerations, including but not limited to, airport  availability, weather conditions and distance to be covered, as assessed by the  doctor and support staff, will determine whether transport will be provided by  private, medically equipped aircraft, helicopter, regular schedule flight, rail  or road. </p>
                <h5>Inter-hospital Transfer</h5>
                <p>If the  doctor, in consultation with the attending doctor, determines that treatment  should continue at an alternate medical facility (because the necessary  treatment cannot be continued at the present facility) we will arrange for  transportation to the closest facility where the treatment can be continued  after you have been stabilised.</p>
                <h5>Medical Repatriation</h5>
                <p> In the  event of your hospitalisation outside of your hometown, we will assist in  arranging for your repatriation to your hometown once you have been treated.</p>
                <h5>Escorted Return of Minors</h5>
                <p> In the  event of your children being stranded as a result of your hospitalisation, we  will arrange for their transportation, under supervision where necessary, into  the care of a person nominated by you.</p>
                <h5>Compassionate Visits</h5>
                <p> Should you  be hospitalised outside your hometown for a period exceeding five (5)  consecutive days, we will arrange for the transportation of a close relative to  visit you. </p>
                <p><em><strong>Please  note:</strong> This cover is only valid within the borders of South Africa. There is an  annual limit of R20&nbsp;000 per policy.</em></p>
